//! Mechanisms for handling and defining system calls.
//!
//! # System Call Overview
//!
//! Tock supports six system calls. The `allow_readonly`, `allow_readwrite`,
//! `subscribe`, `yield`, and `memop` system calls are handled by the core
//! kernel, while `command` is implemented by drivers. The main system calls:
//!
//! - `subscribe` passes a upcall to the driver which it can invoke on the
//!   process later, when an event has occurred or data of interest is
//!   available.
//! - `command` tells the driver to do something immediately.
//! - `allow_readwrite` provides the driver read-write access to an application
//!   buffer.
//! - `allow_userspace_readable` provides the driver read-write access to an
//!   application buffer that is still shared with the app.
//! - `allow_readonly` provides the driver read-only access to an application
//!   buffer.
//!
//! ## Mapping system-calls to drivers
//!
//! Each of these three system calls takes at least two parameters. The first is
//! a _driver identifier_ and tells the scheduler which driver to forward the
//! system call to. The second parameters is a __syscall number_ and is used by
//! the driver to differentiate instances of the call with different
//! driver-specific meanings (e.g. `subscribe` for "data received" vs
//! `subscribe` for "send completed"). The mapping between _driver identifiers_
//! and drivers is determined by a particular platform, while the _syscall
//! number_ is driver-specific.
//!
//! One convention in Tock is that _driver minor number_ 0 for the `command`
//! syscall can always be used to determine if the driver is supported by the
//! running kernel by checking the return code. If the return value is greater
//! than or equal to zero then the driver is present. Typically this is
//! implemented by a null command that only returns 0, but in some cases the
//! command can also return more information, like the number of supported
//! devices (useful for things like the number of LEDs).
//!
//! # The `yield` system call class
//!
//! While drivers do not handle `yield` system calls, it is important to
//! understand them and how they interact with `subscribe`, which registers
//! upcall functions with the kernel. When a process calls a `yield` system
//! call, the kernel checks if there are any pending upcalls for the process. If
//! there are pending upcalls, it pushes one upcall onto the process stack. If
//! there are no pending upcalls, `yield-wait` will cause the process to sleep
//! until a upcall is triggered, while `yield-no-wait` returns immediately.
//!
//! # Method result types
//!
//! Each driver method has a limited set of valid return types. Every method has
//! a single return type corresponding to success and a single return type
//! corresponding to failure. For the `subscribe` and `allow` system calls,
//! these return types are the same for every instance of those calls. Each
//! instance of the `command` system call, however, has its own specified return
//! types. A command that requests a timestamp, for example, might return a
//! 32-bit number on success and an error code on failure, while a command that
//! requests time of day in microsecond granularity might return a 64-bit number
//! and a 32-bit timezone encoding on success, and an error code on failure.
//!
//! These result types are represented as safe Rust types. The core kernel (the
//! scheduler and syscall dispatcher) is responsible for encoding these types
//! into the Tock system call ABI specification.
